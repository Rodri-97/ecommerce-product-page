## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I had been using flex more often than grid in my last projects, but for this one I ended up using grid more often because itâ€™s more useful for making elements the same size.
I also learned how to import pass a whole component (ImageSlider) as prop to another component (Lightbox).

### Continued development

I'm still not sure what's the best way to style React applications. At the start of this project I thought I would be using CSS modules but then I decided that plain Sass would be a cleaner and less tedious solution.
