## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- I had been using flex more often than grid in my last projects, but for this one I ended up using grid more often because itâ€™s more useful for making elements the same size.
- I also learned how to pass a whole component (ImageSlider) as prop to another component (Lightbox).

### Continued development

I'm still not sure what's the best way to style React applications. At the start of this project I thought I would be using CSS modules but then I decided that plain Sass would be a cleaner and less tedious solution. I might try styled components in the future.
